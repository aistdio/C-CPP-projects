# PhoneBook
A program that stores a directory of telephone numbers (name, phone number) in memory. It is filled with 100,000 entries. Every N milliseconds, a random number of records change their phone number to a different one. After T seconds from the start of the program, the console displays the entries that were in the directory M seconds ago.

N, M, T are random numbers, where 500<N<5000, 0<M<30, 60<T<300

The value of N is determined anew each time before the next change in the directory numbers.
